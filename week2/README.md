#Week 2 Notes

This week I have added 3 shapes into the week2 sketch me file. The idea is to have 3 overlapping shapes, being a triangle, cirle, and arc from left to right. My VS code was not letting me view preview, so I do not have any idea if what I did was correct but the idea is to have 3 overlapping shapes. I also played around with the let function and also strokes, fill, and strokeweights.
