#### Reading: Why We’re Not Using AI in This Course, Despite Its Obvious Benefits

#### Quote 1
> There’s a big difference between learning how to generate credible philosophical content and learning how to think like a philosopher. (Lin, Patrick)

This quote really resonated with me as it encapsulates the essence of the entire reading. The use of LLMs is often backed up by the need for convenience and efficiency, and with the increased capabilities of some AI models, they can even start to think for us. But as thinking and speech is core to being human, we cannot let this skill be stripped from us. I really like how the author phrased this sentence, on how generating and being the one to think are two different things.

#### Quote 2
> The university is a gym for your mind. For both body and mind, your abilities and skills atrophy or decline when they’re not used, like a dead limb, for efficiency and energy-savings. (Lin, Patrick)

I have heard this quote somewhere else, unsure if by the same person, but that is why it especially stood out to me. This speaks so much volme because we often overlook the fact that the brain is a muscle as well that needs training and maintenance. This is highly relevant to the point that the author is trying to convey as the excessive use of LLMs make us think less and that leads to the death of our brain. 

#### quote 3
> Is that really the future you’re preparing for, where you have no competitive advantage in a generic job market? If so, your future is already lost, and you’re just studying to become another overworked cog in a machine. (Lin Patrick)

I do not fully agree with the author in this context. He mentions our future very casually, even though in reality, even being different and having a competitive advantage does not guarantee anything and might just lead to being another cog in the machine. I think there is more nuance to this that is not touched upon in the essay such as oversaturation, the luck aspect, and how it is sometimes not viable to do things outside the 'system'.
